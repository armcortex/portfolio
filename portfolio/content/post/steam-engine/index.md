I talk about diving into machining to build a steam engine from scratch. It was a hands-on project 
blending robotics passion with vintage tech, and it turned out to be a great way to learn mechanical skillsâ€‹.

As a bonafide robotics enthusiast, I believe that getting down and dirty with machining tools is an absolute must. It's like learning the secret language of your bot buddies, right? But I didn't want to just learn lathe skills in a vacuum - I wanted a real deal project. So, I set my sights on something steamy, and voila! Crafted myself a steam engine. Now, that's what I call a crash course in mechanical mastery with a hint of vintage charm. Talk about fanning the flames of passion, eh?
